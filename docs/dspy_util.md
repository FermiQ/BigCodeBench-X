# dspy_util.py

## Overview

The `dspy_util.py` script provides utility functions to enhance working with the DSPy library. The primary function in this version of the file, `incremental_parallel`, offers a way to apply a DSPy module to a collection of examples in parallel batches while yielding results incrementally as they are processed. This can be particularly useful for large datasets where processing everything at once might be inefficient or where observing results progressively is beneficial.

The script notes that its content is adapted from an internal repository, `github.com/nuprl/prl_ml`.

## Key Components

### Functions

-   **`incremental_parallel(module: dspy.Module, examples: Iterable[dspy.Example], batch_size: int, use_tqdm: bool = True) -> Iterable[Optional[dspy.Prediction]]`**:
    -   **Purpose**: Enables parallel batch processing of DSPy examples with incremental result yielding. It applies a given `dspy.Module` to an iterable of `dspy.Example` objects, processing them in batches of a specified size.
    -   **Inputs**:
        -   `module: dspy.Module`: The DSPy module (e.g., `dspy.ChainOfThought`, custom `dspy.Module`) to be executed for each example.
        -   `examples: Iterable[dspy.Example]`: An iterable (expected to be a list or sliceable sequence) of `dspy.Example` objects that will be processed.
        -   `batch_size: int`: The number of examples to process concurrently in each batch. This determines the number of threads used by the internal `dspy.Parallel` executor.
        -   `use_tqdm: bool` (default: `True`): If `True`, a `tqdm` progress bar will be displayed to track the progress of batch processing.
    -   **Processing**:
        1.  Initializes a `dspy.Parallel` executor. This executor is configured with:
            -   `num_threads=batch_size`: Sets the parallelism level to the batch size.
            -   `max_errors=batch_size`: Allows a full batch to encounter errors without halting the entire process for subsequent batches.
            -   `return_failed_examples=False`: Configures the executor not to yield failed examples as part of its normal output stream (though the exact behavior of error handling might depend on the DSPy version and specific errors).
            -   `provide_traceback=False`: Disables automatic traceback provision by `dspy.Parallel`.
            -   `disable_progress_bar=True`: Disables `dspy.Parallel`'s own progress bar, as `tqdm` is handled by this function if `use_tqdm` is true.
        2.  Iterates through the `examples` in chunks defined by `batch_size`.
        3.  If `use_tqdm` is true, this iteration is wrapped with a `tqdm` progress bar.
        4.  For each batch, it prepares a list of `exec_pairs`. Each pair consists of the `module` to be run and the input fields extracted from the `dspy.Example` (using `example.inputs()`).
        5.  The `parallel_executor.forward(exec_pairs)` method is called, which executes the module on all examples in the current batch concurrently.
        6.  The function then iterates through the results returned by `parallel_executor.forward()` for the current batch and yields each `dspy.Prediction` object.
    -   **Output**: An iterable yielding `Optional[dspy.Prediction]` objects. The `Optional` indicates that a result for a given example might not be present, especially considering `return_failed_examples=False`.

## Important Variables/Constants

This module does not define global constants. The key variables are those passed as arguments to `incremental_parallel` and objects from the DSPy library (`dspy.Module`, `dspy.Example`, `dspy.Prediction`, `dspy.Parallel`).

## Usage Examples

```python
import dspy
from tqdm.auto import tqdm # tqdm is used by the function

# Define a simple DSPy module for demonstration
class SimpleQA(dspy.Signature):
    """Ask a question, get an answer."""
    question = dspy.InputField()
    answer = dspy.OutputField()

class MyQAProgram(dspy.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        # Using dspy.Predict for simplicity; could be a more complex chain
        self.predictor = dspy.Predict(SimpleQA)

    def forward(self, question):
        return self.predictor(question=question)

# --- Example Setup (replace with your actual LM and data) ---
# 1. Configure DSPy Language Model (ensure your LM is set up, e.g., OpenAI API key)
# try:
#     lm = dspy.OpenAI(model="gpt-3.5-turbo-instruct", max_tokens=100) # Example: Using OpenAI
#     dspy.settings.configure(lm=lm)
# except Exception as e:
#     print(f"Failed to configure LM: {e}. Ensure your LM provider (e.g., OpenAI) is set up.")
#     exit()
#
# 2. Create your DSPy module instance
# qa_program = MyQAProgram()
#
# 3. Prepare your examples
# questions_list = [
#     "What is the capital of France?",
#     "Who wrote 'To Kill a Mockingbird'?",
#     "What is the formula for water?",
#     "When did World War II end?",
#     "What is the main component of air?"
# ]
# dspy_examples = [dspy.Example(question=q).with_inputs("question") for q in questions_list]
# --- End Example Setup ---

# Assuming qa_program and dspy_examples are defined and DSPy LM is configured:
#
# print(f"Processing {len(dspy_examples)} examples with batch_size=2...")
# results_generator = incremental_parallel(
#     module=qa_program,
#     examples=dspy_examples,
#     batch_size=2,
#     use_tqdm=True
# )
#
# print("\nReceived Results:")
# for i, prediction in enumerate(results_generator):
#     if prediction:
#         # Accessing output fields defined in the MyQAProgram's signature (SimpleQA)
#         print(f"Result {i+1}: Question: '{dspy_examples[i].question}', Answer: '{prediction.answer}'")
#     else:
#         # This case might occur if dspy.Parallel is configured to suppress errors/failed examples
#         print(f"Result {i+1}: Failed to get a prediction for question: '{dspy_examples[i].question}'")

# Note: For the above example to run, you need to have an LM configured for DSPy.
# If you don't have an OpenAI key, you can try with a local model via dspy.Ollama or similar.
```

## Dependencies and Interactions

-   **External Libraries**:
    -   `dspy`: This is the core dependency. The function `incremental_parallel` is specifically designed to work with DSPy components like `dspy.Module`, `dspy.Example`, `dspy.Prediction`, and leverages `dspy.Parallel` for concurrent execution.
    -   `tqdm`: Used to provide an optional progress bar for iterating over batches, enhancing user experience for long-running tasks.
-   **DSPy Environment**:
    -   The successful execution of `incremental_parallel` depends on a correctly configured DSPy environment, particularly a language model (`dspy.LM`) being set via `dspy.settings.configure(lm=...)`.
    -   The behavior of error handling and what is yielded for failed examples can be influenced by the configuration of `dspy.Parallel` and the specific version of DSPy.
-   **Input Data Structure**: The `examples` parameter is expected to be an iterable that supports slicing (like a list) and contains `dspy.Example` objects. Each example must be compatible with the input signature of the provided `dspy.Module`.
